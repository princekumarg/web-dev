    <p>Noodles are a type of food made from unleavened dough which is rolled flat and cut,
       stretched or extruded, into strips or strings. Noodles are a staple food in many 
       cultures (see Chinese noodles, Filipino noodles, Indonesian noodles, Japanese noodles, 
       Korean noodles, Vietnamese noodles, and Italian pasta) made from unleavened dough which 
       is stretched, extruded, or rolled flat and cut into one of a variety of shapes. While 
       long, thin strips may be the most common, many varieties of noodles are cut into waves,
       helices, tubes, strings, or shells, or folded over, or cut into other shapes. Noodles 
       are usually cooked in boiling water, sometimes with cooking oil or salt added. They are 
       often pan-fried or deep-fried. Noodles are often served with an accompanying sauce or 
       in a soup. Noodles can be refrigerated for short-term storage or dried and stored for 
       future use.</p>

    <img src="./img/potato-soup-2152254_1280.jpg" alt="img of soup" width="50%" height="300px">
    <p>Soup is a primarily liquid food, generally served warm or hot, that is made by 
        combining ingredients of meat or vegetables with stock, milk, or water. Hot 
        soups are additionally characterized by boiling solid ingredients in liquids in a 
        pot until the flavors are extracted, forming a broth. Soups are similar to stews, 
        and in some cases there may not be a clear distinction between the two; however, 
        soups generally have more liquid (broth) than stews.</p>
